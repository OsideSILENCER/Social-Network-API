# Social-Network-API

I was motivated by my motivation to succeed in back end properties and to master its utilization.

I built this project utilizing multiple javascript pages, MongoDB, schema and gitignore and finally deploying it via Insomnia. I had issues making all the functions work and i broke the code unfortunately. I tried to get rid if the utils folder but it keeps pulling information from somewhere and I gave up trying to figure out where. 

#Installation In order to install the Social-Network-API you must have a multitude of complex javascript pages featuring tags, routes and seeds and a gitignore. You must then ensure that the env and npm commands run properly. Only then can you utiilize the website.

#Usage In order to use the Social Network API simply run it in insomnia typing in "http://localhost:3001/api/ and after either type in id's after local host or type in the information via json and hit send and hopefully the information comes up.
