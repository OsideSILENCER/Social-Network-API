# Social-Network-API

I was motivated by my motivation to succeed in back end properties and to master its utilization.

I built this project utilizing multiple javascript pages, MongoDB, schema and gitignore. I had issues connecting the different pages to the Heroku App.

#Installation In order to install the Social-Network-API you must have a multitude of complex javascript pages featuring tags, routes and seeds and a gitignore. You must then ensure that the env and npm commands run properly. Only then can you utiilize the website.

#Usage In order to use the Social Network API simply run it in insomnia typing in "http://localhost:3001/api/ and after the forward slash type in any of the namess of the pages used by the api to display them in insomnia such as thoughts, users etcetera."
